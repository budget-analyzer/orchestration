## Usage Notes

### When to Create an ADR
- Any architectural decision that affects multiple services
- Technology choices (framework selection, version upgrades)
- Pattern changes (new testing strategy, API design conventions)
- Infrastructure decisions (add message queue, switch databases)

### ADR Numbering
Use sequential numbering: `001-title.md`, `002-title.md`, etc.

### Status Lifecycle
- **Proposed**: Decision under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and being implemented
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (reference the new ADR)
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable but kept for historical context

### Tips for Writing Good ADRs
1. **Context is key**: Explain the problem clearly before the solution
2. **Document alternatives**: Show you considered multiple approaches
3. **Be honest about consequences**: Every decision has tradeoffs
4. **Keep it concise**: Aim for 1-2 pages
5. **Link references**: Connect to related docs, PRs, issues
